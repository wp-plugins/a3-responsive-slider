A robust and versatile responsive image slider for WordPress.

== Description ==

There are hundreds of image sliders for WordPress. We know because we have used a lot and none have ever completely been what we wanted. We built our own because we wanted a versatile and robust responsive slider that we could use in our client website work and more importantly that our clients could easily use on their site.

a3 Responsive Slider is inspired by and powered by the [malsup Cycle2](https://github.com/malsup/cycle2) JavaScript.
